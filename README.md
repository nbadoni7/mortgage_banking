# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Neeti Akhilesh Thapliyal's Contributions (UI SQUAD -- 2)

### 1. **Reusable Components**
   - Designed and developed reusable components for the application, including:
     - **Root Layout**
     - **Header**
     - **Navigation**
     - **Footer**
   - These components ensured consistency across the app and streamlined the development process for the team.

### 2. **Login Module**
   - Developed a fully functional **Login Module**.
   - Added **Unit Tests** covering:
     - Form rendering
     - Empty field validation
     - Successful login dispatch
     - Error handling for invalid credentials.

### 3. **Dashboard Page**
   - Created a **Dashboard Page** to display a summary of the user's account information in a visually appealing layout.
   - Made the page fully **responsive** and optimized for different screen sizes.

### 4. **Redux Store Integration**
   - Integrated both the **Login** and **Dashboard** pages with the **Redux Store** to efficiently manage application state.
   - Implemented Redux actions and reducers to handle authentication and account-related data.

### 5. **Firebase API Integration**
   - Integrated the **Login Module** and **Dashboard Page** with **Firebase API** for:
     - User authentication
     - Fetching and managing account data dynamically.

### 6. **Shared APIs**
   - Hosted **common APIs** for the entire team, facilitating seamless integration and simplifying development workflows.

### 7. **Version Control**
   - Checked in the project codebase into the **Git Repository**, ensuring proper version control and collaboration within the team.

### 8. **Technologies and Tools**
   - Leveraged:
     - **React Hooks** for managing component state and lifecycle.
     - **Redux** for global state management.
     - **Fetch APIs** for seamless communication with backend services.

### 9. **Password Encryption**
   - Enhanced security by using the **`btoa` JavaScript API** to base64 encode passwords in the Login Module.
